# These are auto build and deploy workflows (CD) for bworks on AWS VM instance

## There are 4 files corresponding to 4 auto build and deploy workflows for API , CMS , EMP , JSK
## What workflows do :

- Build code and upload results to github artifacts (expire in 1 day) , you can view and download artifacts from completed workflows at Actions --> Workflows
  --> choose completed workflow --> view uploaded artifact at bottom.
- Rsync artifacts (api/dist , cms/build , emp/build , jsk/build) to AWS VM instance
- Restart service on AWS VM instance

## Workflows will be triggerd automatically when : 
- Source code is merged from branch master --> staging (Pull Request is created -> reviewed -> closed) & code changes in api , cms , emp , jsk folders
## To trigger workflows mannually you have to change default branch to "staging" (default is master):
- Settings --> Branches --> Default branch
